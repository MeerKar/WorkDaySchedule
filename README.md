#  Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## This project is divided into three parts,


1. Introduction

2. Problem

3. Solution


# Introduction

 In this project a simple calendar application is created that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. 
 This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The library  [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) is used  to work with date and time and can add important events to the daily planner to manage the time effectively


# Problem

The provided initial code required debugging to ensure proper functionality with the correct JavaScript file.


# Solution

When using the daily planner the current day and time is displayed at the top the calender.
And it is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm. 
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is past, present or future.
When a text  or event is clicked it saves and in the local storage and it persist after refreshing ing the page.
